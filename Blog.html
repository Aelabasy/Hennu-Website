            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Hennu is a professional palm oil trading company specializing in refined, crude, and palm kernel oil.
                Our mission is to deliver high-quality products while supporting sustainable and ethical palm cultivation practices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Founded on the banks of the Nile, Hennu bridges local producers with international markets, ensuring transparency,
                quality, and timely delivery. From palm groves to warehouses, our seamless supply chain guarantees that each product
                meets the highest standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, Hennu has expanded its operations to include state-of-the-art refining facilities, quality control laboratories,
                and a network of reliable logistics partners. This expansion allows us to consistently meet the growing demand for palm oil products
                across multiple industries, including food, cosmetics, and biofuel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our team is composed of experienced traders, quality assurance experts, and logistics specialists who work together
                to provide exceptional service. We prioritize long-term partnerships and believe in building trust through reliability
                and transparency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sustainability is at the heart of Hennu’s operations. We continuously invest in environmentally friendly practices,
                such as reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, and promoting responsible farming techniques. Additionally,
                Hennu actively supports local communities by providing training and employment opportunities, fostering social and economic growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the global demand for sustainable palm oil rises, Hennu remains committed to leading the industry with integrity,
                innovation, and a focus on quality. We believe that responsible business practices can coexist with profitability,
                and our clients trust us to deliver products that meet both ethical and commercial standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Hennu, every bottle of palm oil tells a story — a story of tradition, dedication, and a commitment to creating value
                for our clients and communities alike.
